Howto use ACOMA to encode a file into a set of oligos on a Macbook pro 
and a linux system. After following the steps below you will have 
produced a number of oligos that represent a given file with added redundancy.

We will utilize the go run process for running our tools since we will be potentially
modifying src code and then running.

Assumptions:
   -bash shell
   -17nt datablock size
   -You have followed HOWTO-setup-go-and-acoma.txt to verify
    a working go and acoma install
   -ALTGOPATH points to a path where acoma is installed
   -an encode table exists with 17nt oligos and enough entries to facilitate
    encoding the desired file

1. Create an input file and verify contents

   1.1 Use the dd command to create a new file with random content:

         dd if=/dev/urandom of=$HOME/32kfilerand bs=16k count=2

   1.2 Determine md5sum of file and save to compare against later:

         md5sum $HOME/32kfilerand >> $HOME/checksum_32kfilerand

   1.3 Check size of file to ensure accuracy (especially if you are not creating it
       like above)

         stat $HOME/32kfilerand >> $HOME/statof_32kfilerand

2. Plan for oligo length and adjust parameters accordingly

   2.1 17nt is datablock size, this is hardcoded in many places of ACOMA and results
       in a 32bit usable block size.


   2.2 Determine number of data blocks the oligo will contain. This will impact the number 
       of metadata blocks an oligo contains as well. For this exercise we choose the default
       of 5 datablocks per oligo. This is currently hardcoded in the file:
       
       ALTGOPATH/src/acoma/encode/main.go, line 42, as the 3rd parameter 
       of the function "l2.NewCodec"

       Current oligo length is: 17nt/datablock * 5datablocks/oligo = 85nt/oligo

   2.3 Determine the number of Reed-Solomon metadata erasure blocks that the 
       oligo will contain. This is used to protect against errors in MD blocks. 
       It will impact the number of metadata blocks an oligo can hold. Metadata erasure 
       blocks are 5nt in size. We will choose the default of 2 for this exercise. 
       If you would like to modify this value, it is in the file:
       
       ALTGOPATH/src/acoma/encode/main.go, line 42, as the 5th parameter
       of the function "l2.NewCodec" 

       Current oligo length is: 85 + 5nt/MD_RS * 2MD_RS/oligo = 95nt/oligo

   2.4 Determine the sizeof a metadata block. ACOMA currently supports either 3, 4, or 5nt
       metadata blocks. As described in the ACOMA design docs, the amount of addressable
       space is governed by number of datablocks, number of RS metadata blocks, and sizeof
       metadata blocks. We will choose the default of 4nt metadatablock size. If you would
       like to modify this value, it is in the file:

       ALTGOPATH/src/acoma/encode/main.go, line 42, as the 4th parameter
       of the function "l2.NewCodec"

       With our current chosen parameters, we are able to address up to 1608714 addresses
       or ~30MB. This is plenty for our 32KiB sample file.

       Current oligo length is: 95 + 4nt/MD * (#datablocks <5> - #RSMD_blocks <2>) = 107nt 
      

3. Plan for erasure protection amongst oligo groups

   3.1 Determine the number of data oligos in an erasure group. The default value is 3.
       This can be modified as a parameter passed into the encode/main.go tool as

       -dseqnum <val>


   3.2 Determine the number of erasure oligos per erasure group. This is the added
       redundancy for the data oligos. The default value is 2. This can be modified as a
       parameter passed into the encode/main.go tool as:

       -rseqnum <val>

   3.3 These values impact the total number of oligos produced and the amount of error
       protection included by the codec

4. Choose primers or other sequences desired for the 3' or 5'-end

   4.1 3'-end primer can be set to empty string if desired. The default primer is 20nt 
       and can be found using the --help option to encode/main.go. We will use the default, 
       but it is specified by using the -p3 parameter when running the encode tool. 

   4.2 Currently the 5'-end primer must be at least 4nt. The default primer is 20nt and 
       can be found using the --help option to encode/main.go. We will use the default,
       but it is specified by using the -p5 parameter when running the encode tool.

   Using the two default primers, we will find that our total oligo length is: 147nt

5. Put it all together to encode our test file

   5.1 The above changes to src code (if applicable) should have already been made before
       continuing beyond this step.

   5.2 Run encoder tool, redirecting output to a file to store oligos:

         cd ALTGOPATH/src/acoma/
         go run encode/main.go -dseqnum 3 -rseqnum 2 -etbl tbl/encnt17b13.tbl \
            -p3 CAGTGAGCTGGCAACTTCCA -p5 CGACATCTCGATGGCAGCAT $HOME/32kfilerand >> dna.out

6. Quick sanity checks

   6.1 You can check for oligo count using wc. Note: there is an empty line at the beginning
       of the file. It is also worthwhile to verify oligo length.

   6.2 Congratulations these oligos represent the sample file.
